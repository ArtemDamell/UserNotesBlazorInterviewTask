Here is an assignment for a Junior ASP .NET Developer:

Create a simple web application that allows users to register and login. Once logged in, users should be able to create, read, update, and delete simple notes. 
Each note should have a title, a body, and a date/time stamp indicating when it was created.

The application should have the following features:

•	A registration page that allows users to create a new account by entering a username and password.

•	A login page that allows users to log in with their username and password.

•	A dashboard page that displays a list of all notes created by the logged-in user.

•	An add note page that allows the user to create a new note by entering a title and body.

•	An edit note page that allows the user to edit an existing note.

•	A delete note feature that allows the user to delete a note.

•	Use of a database to store the user account information and notes.

•	Use of ASP .NET Identity for user authentication and authorization.

Bonus points for implementing additional features such as:

• Pagination of notes on the dashboard page.

• Search functionality for notes.

• User profile page with ability to change password and edit user details.
